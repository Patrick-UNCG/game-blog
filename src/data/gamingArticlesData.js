        paragraph1:`S rank: Jett and Chamber are still absolutely broken in my opinion (A Peak Plat Player lol) but their safety just lets them
        takeover a game in the hands of a good player. Sova is still good despite the drone nerfs, players continue to find new lineups, and Omen is
        the only smoke I can play that doesn't make me fall asleep so that makes him S.`,
        paragraph2:`A rank: All these agents are good with good utility focus, except Reyna who is only here since she is easy to climb with, having a heal and 
        invincibilty, the rest have game changing utility options, Skye's flash, Fades ult and eyeball, Viper, Stimmy, Raze nade, and KAYO knife/ult.`, 
        paragraph3:`B rank: These agents are not bad in my opinion but should be used if you have more knowledge on the agent, for example Killjoy and Cypher setups 
        Astra star UI, Breach utily usage, and Phoenix is making a comeback but I still think his ult is garbage.`,
        paragraph4:`C rank: Neon is hard to play, look at Optic Victor play him and tell me its not insane, Yoru is a niche pick why play him when you can play KAYO or Skye 
        and Sage needs a buff her wall is garbage, her res is situational and her heal does not top people off in certain scenarios.`,

        paragraph1:`Number 5: VALORANT, it can be fun and rewarding, all the while being one of the most frustrating things this world has to offer, especially the smurfs, 
        but the concept of the games is very interesting, a tac shooter with abilities for each agent.`,
        paragraph2:`Number 4: Escape From Tarkov, the only game left that can make my heart rate reach dangerous levels, this game is super hardcore and gives so much 
        dopamine when you successfully extract with that Chad's juicy loot.` , 
        paragraph3:`Number 3: Rust, another heart pumping game, this time survival-esque, I've played since 2016 and the updates they keep adding make the game feel 
        fun and refreshing every time.` ,
        paragraph4:`Number 2: Vampire Survivors, this is my favorite rouge-like, it is so simple yet effective, and the dev is severely underselling himself with this one 
        it is an amazing game.` ,
        paragraph5:`Number 1: Elden Ring, probably game of the year, great world, bosses, npcs, combat, the whole thing. I don't play many dark souls games, but this one 
        was so hyped I had to buy it and give it a try.` ,

        paragraph1:`Number 5: Pokemon HeartGold, love the follow system where your pokemon would follow you around, also better than Soulsilver since you can get 
        Growlithe.`,
        paragraph2:`Number 4: Pokemon FireRed, solid game, only gripe is that the only good fire-type you get is Charizard, but has the original pokemon in it so 
        the nostalgia is there.` , 
        paragraph3:`Number 3: Pokemon Emerald, a fan-favorite, I really like the poster pokemon and the champion is pretty cool with his Metagross, also the bikes 
        in this game are pretty diifferent than others.` ,
        paragraph4:`Number 2: Pokemon Crystal, the first Pokemon game I played, I really liked how you had to train eevee in the night time or day time in order to evolve them, 
         the rival was not absolutely horrible at batting, also Suicune is a sick Pokemon` ,
        paragraph5:`Number 1: Pokemon Platinum, first Pokemon game I played on DS, great game, best Champion fight, good soundtrack, favorite starter, I can go on but
         its a great game that is loved by many.` ,

        paragraph1:`Number 5: Salamence, the only dragon type on this list, and my favorite dragon, although he is harder to obtain in the gen 3 games, 
        this Pokemon's design is so beautiful and it is how I imagine a dragon should look like, it stands on four legs, unlike some other dragons who are
         serpentine like or bipedal.`,
        paragraph2:`Number 4: Heracross, a fighting-bug type is a horrible pairing, but the design of Heracross is very unique and interesting, 
        hes like this horned beetle that can use fighting moves to beat the hell out of the other Pokemon but has wings and can't fly. 
        Also his mega is ugly in my opinion.` , 
        paragraph3:`Number 3: Scizor, this is probably the best designed Pokemon for me, but the others on the list have other features about them that put them above Scizor, 
        he only has one weakness which is fire and looks like an armored bug with scissor hands which I think is cool as hell, his mega is alright but I prefer the original.` ,
        paragraph4:`Number 2: Tyranitar, this guy could of been a dragon type in my opinion but he's more like a dinosaur that has the life cycle of a butterfly,, I love the design 
        and the unique typing of this Pokemon and its mega is actually visual appealing for once.`,
        paragraph5:`Number 1: Chimchar, my starter in Platinum,also my favorite Pokemon Game, I love this little fire monkey, the design is simple and in the anime 
        you feel very bad for Chimchar as he is abandoned by his original trainer, Paul so you can't help but to root for this little guy.` ,
