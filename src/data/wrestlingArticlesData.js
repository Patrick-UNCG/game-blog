        paragraph1:`Randy Orton and Team Hell No vs The Shield: Greatest Smackdown main event in my honest opinion, this match was a suprise to many as the Shield were literal Gods and could not be 
        beaten, like the kelvar vests just absorbs all the moves that they get hit with, so when Randy and Team Hell No won this match I was so pumped, 
        something out of left field, truly one of the greatest moments in WWE history.`,
        paragraph2:`2017 Survivor Series match: This match had some of the hypest matchups in it from Cena and Angle, and Triple H and Roode, the only gripe I have with this match 
        is that Braun literally buried everyone, but other than that it was a fun match.`, 
        paragraph3:`Brock Lesnar vs John Cena vs Seth Rollins: This match is great, it had a solid build up and made Seth look like a star, of course every Brock match thats not 
        one on one has him taking a spot where he is out for most the match, but this one was realistic with an elbow drop on the announce table.`,
        paragraph4:`AJ Styles vs John Cena Royal Rumble 2017: Favorite match from their trilogy, and John Cena ties Ric Flair for the most World Championship reigns, I really 
        did not expect Cena to win since he was a part-timer, but this was a special win for him, and a great match.`,
        paragraph5:`NXT North American Championship Ladder Match: One of the funnest matches to watch, it had nonstop action back to back and Ricochet did some of the craziest spots 
        ever. EC3 also took some of the hardest hits in a wrestling match and the winner Adam Cole was so over with the crowd.`,

        paragraph1:`I think he's doing great with the hand that he was dealt with, I don't agree with him taking Seth Rollins vs Riddle off of Summerslam 
        as Seth is one of the major draws to WWE right now.`,
        paragraph2:"" , 
        paragraph3:`Dexter Lumis is one of my favorite gimmicks right now, its so unique and funny that it works, and I hope he doesn't actually wrestle but 
        just continue to abduct wrestlers from their matches.` ,
        paragraph4:`Clash at the Castle was insanely good, Triple H is letting all these wrestlers go out their and do their own thing, Sheamus vs Gunther was a hardhitting 
        classic which was a suprise to me since Sheamus is not really known for putting on good matches.` ,
        paragraph5:`One of my only gripes so far was not letting Drew win the main event, he was so over with the crowd, it would of been a top ten moment of wrestling history, 
        the stadium would of exploded if he won. Bringing back Broken Dreams was cool though` ,

        paragraph1:`Number 5: Kurt Angle, Kurt was at his peak in TNA in my opinion when he was on those painkillers, he use to do some of the craziest spots 
        just because he could, it was insane, his work in the early 2000s was also phenomenal, creating some of the funniest moments in WWE history.`,
        paragraph2:`Number 4: Randy Orton, a household name at this point, given all the memes and vines made about him, but he is almost always going to 
        have a big reaction from the crowd whether he is a heel or a face, one of the GOATS of the last 20 years of wrestling.` , 
        paragraph3:`Number 3: AJ Styles, greatest technical wrestler since HBK, he has some of the best matches and can work with any wrestler and make them 
        look like a million bucks, his matches with Reigns, Cena are classics in my opinion.` ,
        paragraph4:`Number 2: Jeff Hardy, greatest story of wrestling in my opinion, this dude was a drug abuser, alcohol abuser, got arrested, and came back to WWE 
        won the belt and threw it all away again time after time, but seriously he had the crowd behind him always someone you want to see succeed.` ,
        paragraph5:`Number 1: John Morrison, its a shame how he was used in WWE, but I liked his character, I thought he was entertaining, in and out of the ring and 
        the fact that he never got a world title reign is criminal, also he had a sick finisher but always failed to hit it I don't know why.` ,

        the same theme that played when he won the WWE Championship, it is always going to get a reaction from the crowd.`,
        paragraph2:`Number 4: Metalingus-Edge, iconic theme, a fan favorite, it suits Edge so well as the ultimate opportunist, and his entrance with the pyro
         is so good.` , 
        paragraph3:`Number 3: Medal-Kurt Angle, this theme is another iconic one simply because no matter where the stadium is, the crowd is always going to chant You Suck 
        at Kurt as he is making his way to the ring. It is one of the longest traditions in WWE still to this day.` ,
        paragraph4:`Number 2: Broken Dreams-Drew McIntyre, I played so much Smackdown vs Raw as a kid and this song would always come on in the background so I just got used to it 
        , Drew's original run was easily forgetable but this theme stuck and when he played it at Clash at the Castle I was so pumped.` ,
        paragraph5:`Number 1: Fire Burns-CM Punk, I wish Punk would use this theme again, it was so good, it fit him so well back in the day. Punk coming out to this song in Chicago 
        was one of the best entrances of all time.` ,
