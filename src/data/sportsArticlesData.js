        paragraph1:"Number 5: Peyton Manning, I love him commentating MNF with his brother, but he was great and had a great ending to his career by winning a Super Bowl.",
        paragraph2:"Number 4: Michael Vick, the best running back on this list, I know hes done bad outside of football, but his game is something that many Quarterbacks \
        are inspired by." , 
        paragraph3:"Number 3: Patty Mahomes, this dude is so fun to watch, him and Josh Allen are the biggest offensive threats I've seen ever, and he sounds like Kermit." ,
        paragraph4:"Number 2: Tim Tebow, I know Tebow is a horrible QB but his playoff win was so hype, and he had the funniest football throw ever, \
        great guy too." ,
        paragraph5:"Number 1: Aaron Rodgers, I'm a Packers fan ever since Super Bowl 45, and I have watched this man give me so many memorable moments throughout the years, \
        and I'll be very sad when he retires." ,

        paragraph1:"Number 5: Tom Brady, this dude always wins, it gets old man, go retire bro, like he always finds a way, he played horrible \
        against the Packers in the playoffs but luck was still on his side, last year he nearly beat the Rams, if that would of have happened I would of flipped.",
        paragraph2:"Number 4: Jimmy Grappolo, good looking guy, but can't throw more then 10 yards without being picked, still somehow beat the Pack twice in the playoffs \
        though, unreal." , 
        paragraph3:"Number 3: Russell Wilson, handed the Packers the most heart-breaking playoff lost in my opinion in 2014, I was so ready to see the Packers in the Super Bowl \
        again then this dude and Marshawn Lynch happened to wake up in the final quarter, also that super unlucky offsides kick." ,
        paragraph4:"Number 2: Brett Farve, when Aaron was drafted he offered him no guidance whatsoever, seems like a dick thing to do to somebody, I mean thats what vets do \
        they offer advice, this dude just seemed bitter that someone was going to replace him eventually, and coped by not being a good teammate or mentor." ,
        paragraph5:"Number 1: Eli Manning, the Packers had one of the best seasons ever in 2011 only to be eliminated by the Giants who won the Super Bowl that year, but still \
        this man was the main reason they won. Eli can either be really good, like HOF level QB or really bad like a Tim Tebow or something, the inconsistency is uncanny." ,

        paragraph1:"Number 5: Lebron James, when I first started watching basketball this dude Lebron was the most talked about player, more than Kobe, people loved to hate him \
        see him fail, make up excuses whenever he did win, but I think he is the GOAT of this generation, his game is so dominant, watching him just takeover games \
        whenever he wants is insane.",
        paragraph2:"Number 4: Jeremy Lin, I'm Asian so whenever I see another Asian excelling in a sport like basketball I tend to root for them, but this dude gave \
        people more than a reason to root for him, Linsanity in my opinion was peak basketball for me, it was so fun to watch him every time, seeing if he can continue, \
        this hot stretch where he was the best player on the court." , 
        paragraph3:"Number 3: James Harden, I like the Sixers so hopefully he can help them get a chip, people hate on his game when he was with the Rockets \
        but I find it amusing how he has 3 moves he can do, either step-back three, drive and draw a foul, or drive and throw a lob. It's like so simple yet effective." ,
        paragraph4:"Number 2: Derrick Rose, when I first started watching basketball I liked the Bulls and Rose was the star player at the time, but I barely get to watch \
        him since hes on the sidelines most the time, I guess that makes watching him novel since he's always injured, nonetheless he was very explosive and fun to watch." ,
        paragraph5:"Number 1: Paul George, people love to hate on this man but I like him, I even own a pair of PGs, his game is so smooth it's unreal, \
        joining the Clippers did make me not like him as much but I think hes still an MVP level player." ,

        to the promise land and is always looking for that next super-team.",
        paragraph2:"Number 4: Dejounte Murray, I saw some videos of this dude beefing with the rookie Paolo Banchero in a Pro-Am game, like really this isn't even \
        the real deal yet, and hes a rookie, he's beefing with a rookie." , 
        paragraph3:"Number 3: Pat Beverly, he's a trash talker, gets under players skin, its like part of his game now, being a little nuisance on the court \
        not just physically but verbally, only players that like him are the ones on his team." ,
        paragraph4:"Number 2: Paul Pierce, he's funny I'll admit, saying he had a better career than D-Wade, and some of the other takes are also very bad \
        like jynxing the Celtics back in 2019." ,
        paragraph5:"Number 1: Draymond Green, he talks a lot and looks goofy when he does not back it up, like scoring 2 points every night, but hes a good player, \
        I just hate how he acts, he literally kicked Steven Adams in the balls, that dude is like the nicest dude on the court night in and night out." ,
