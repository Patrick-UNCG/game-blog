        paragraph1:`Number 5: Peyton Manning, I love him commentating MNF with his brother, but he was great and had a great ending to his career by winning a Super Bowl.`,
        paragraph2:`Number 4: Michael Vick, the best running back on this list, I know hes done bad outside of football, but his game is something that many Quarterbacks 
        are inspired by.` , 
        paragraph3:`Number 3: Patty Mahomes, this dude is so fun to watch, him and Josh Allen are the biggest offensive threats I've seen ever, and he sounds like Kermit.` ,
        paragraph4:`Number 2: Tim Tebow, I know Tebow is a horrible QB but his playoff win was so hype, and he had the funniest football throw ever, 
        great guy too.` ,
        paragraph5:`Number 1: Aaron Rodgers, I'm a Packers fan ever since Super Bowl 45, and I have watched this man give me so many memorable moments throughout the years, 
        and I'll be very sad when he retires.` ,

        paragraph1:`Number 5: Tom Brady, this dude always wins, it gets old man, go retire bro, like he always finds a way, he played horrible 
        against the Packers in the playoffs but luck was still on his side, last year he nearly beat the Rams, if that would of have happened I would of flipped.`,
        paragraph2:`Number 4: Jimmy Grappolo, good looking guy, but can't throw more then 10 yards without being picked, still somehow beat the Pack twice in the playoffs 
        though, unreal.` , 
        paragraph3:`Number 3: Russell Wilson, handed the Packers the most heart-breaking playoff lost in my opinion in 2014, I was so ready to see the Packers in the Super Bowl 
        again then this dude and Marshawn Lynch happened to wake up in the final quarter, also that super unlucky offsides kick.` ,
        paragraph4:`Number 2: Brett Farve, when Aaron was drafted he offered him no guidance whatsoever, seems like a dick thing to do to somebody, I mean thats what vets do 
        they offer advice, this dude just seemed bitter that someone was going to replace him eventually, and coped by not being a good teammate or mentor.` ,
        paragraph5:`Number 1: Eli Manning, the Packers had one of the best seasons ever in 2011 only to be eliminated by the Giants who won the Super Bowl that year, but still 
        this man was the main reason they won. Eli can either be really good, like HOF level QB or really bad like a Tim Tebow or something, the inconsistency is uncanny.`,

        paragraph1:`Number 5: Lebron James, when I first started watching basketball this dude Lebron was the most talked about player, more than Kobe, people loved to hate him 
        see him fail, make up excuses whenever he did win, but I think he is the GOAT of this generation, his game is so dominant, watching him just takeover games 
        whenever he wants is insane.`,
        paragraph2:`Number 4: Jeremy Lin, I'm Asian so whenever I see another Asian excelling in a sport like basketball I tend to root for them, but this dude gave 
        people more than a reason to root for him, Linsanity in my opinion was peak basketball for me, it was so fun to watch him every time, seeing if he can continue, 
        this hot stretch where he was the best player on the court.` , 
        paragraph3:`Number 3: James Harden, I like the Sixers so hopefully he can help them get a chip, people hate on his game when he was with the Rockets 
        but I find it amusing how he has 3 moves he can do, either step-back three, drive and draw a foul, or drive and throw a lob. It's like so simple yet effective.` ,
        paragraph4:`Number 2: Derrick Rose, when I first started watching basketball I liked the Bulls and Rose was the star player at the time, but I barely get to watch 
        him since hes on the sidelines most the time, I guess that makes watching him novel since he's always injured, nonetheless he was very explosive and fun to watch.` ,
        paragraph5:`Number 1: Paul George, people love to hate on this man but I like him, I even own a pair of PGs, his game is so smooth it's unreal, 
        joining the Clippers did make me not like him as much but I think hes still an MVP level player.` ,

        to the promise land and is always looking for that next super-team.`,
        paragraph2:`Number 4: Dejounte Murray, I saw some videos of this dude beefing with the rookie Paolo Banchero in a Pro-Am game, like really this isn't even 
        the real deal yet, and hes a rookie, he's beefing with a rookie.` , 
        paragraph3:`Number 3: Pat Beverly, he's a trash talker, gets under players skin, its like part of his game now, being a little nuisance on the court 
        not just physically but verbally, only players that like him are the ones on his team.` ,
        paragraph4:`Number 2: Paul Pierce, he's funny I'll admit, saying he had a better career than D-Wade, and some of the other takes are also very bad 
        like jynxing the Celtics back in 2019.` ,
        paragraph5:`Number 1: Draymond Green, he talks a lot and looks goofy when he does not back it up, like scoring 2 points every night, but hes a good player,
        I just hate how he acts, he literally kicked Steven Adams in the balls, that dude is like the nicest dude on the court night in and night out.` ,
